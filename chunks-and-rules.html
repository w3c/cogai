    <p>This specification defines a cognitive graph database model featuring chunks as collections of properties, and rules that operate on them in conjunction with highly scalable graph algorithms, and a simple notation for serializing graphs. The model is designed with the aim of facilitating machine learning for vocabularies and rules, and inspired by advances in the cognitive sciences on the organisation of the mammalian brain.</p>

    <p>This document reflects implementation experience, but is still subject to change. Feedback is welcome through <a href="https://github.com/w3c/cogai/issues">GitHub issues</a> or on the <a href="mailto:public-cogai@w3.org">public-cogai@w3.org</a> mailing-list (with <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cogai/">public archives</a>).</p>
  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This specification introduces a simple notation and computational model for chunk graphs and rules. Chunks are collections of properties (name/value pairs) together with sub-symbolic parameters that mimic the characteristics of human memory, including the forgetting curve and stochastic recall. Chunk rules operate on chunk buffers that mimic the connections between the basal ganglia and cortical modules.</p>

    <figure id="cog-arch">
      <img src="demos/chunks/arch.png" alt="" />
      <figcaption>Architecture of the cognitive database model</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>At its heart, the model is based on [=graphs of chunks=] composed of a collection of [=chunks=], where each [=chunk=] represents a collection of basic familiar units that have been grouped together and stored in memory. To ease manipulation of procedural knowledge as declarative knowledge, [=chunks=] are used to model both declarative knowledge (i.e. data) as well as procedural knowledge (i.e. rules). See [[CHUNKS-INTRO]] for details.</p>

    <p>The [=rule engine=] operates on a set of [=modules=], where each [=module=] has a [=graph of chunks=] and supports an <a data-lt="built-in operations">extensible set of operations</a> on chunks. Each module has a single [=module buffer=] that the [=rule engine=] can process, and that can hold one and only one [=chunk=] at a time.</p>

    <p>This specification also defines a <a href="#chunks-documents">serialization format</a> for graphs of chunks, used in examples throughout this specification.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[[RFC5234]]] [[RFC5234]].</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Conformance classes</h3>
      <p>Conformance to this specification is defined for four conformance classes:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Chunks document</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A serialization of a [=graph of chunks=] as a file. A [=chunks document=] is conformant to this specification if it follows the grammar described in <a href="#chunks-grammar"></a>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn>Authoring tool</dfn></dt>
        <dd>An application that writes a [=chunks document=]. An [=authoring tool=] is conformant to this specification if it writes conforming [=chunks documents=].</dd>
        <dt><dfn>Parser</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A [=parser=] transforms a [=chunks document=] into another representation. A [=parser=] is conformant to this specification if it accepts any conforming [=chunks document=].</dd>
        <dt><dfn>Rule engine</dfn></dt>
        <dd>A processing application that operates on graphs of chunks and rules, organized following the cognitive agent architecture described in this specification. A [=rule engine=] is conformant to this specification if it follows the algorithms defined in <a href="#rule-engine-execution"></a>.</dd>
      </dl>

  <section>
    <h2>Data types</h2>
    <p>This document uses the following restricted set of data types to describe [=chunks=]. See <a href="#chunks-grammar"></a> for a formal definition of their serialization.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>number</dfn> represents a double-precision 64-bit format value as specified in the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic [[IEEE-754-2019]]. It is serialized in base 10 using decimal digits, following the same grammar as <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-6">numbers in JSON</a> [[RFC8259]].</p>

    <p>A <dfn>boolean</dfn> represents a logical entity having two values. It is serialized as either the literal name <code>true</code>, which gets interpreted as a truthy value, or the literal name <code>false</code>, which gets interpreted as a falsy value.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>date</dfn> is a string that represents a date according to the [[Date and Time Profile]] of the [[ISO8601]] standard. A [=date=] value implicitly creates a read-only chunk whose type is <code>iso8601</code> with properties that match actual date components.</p>

    <aside class="example" title="Date example">
      <p>Here is an example of a chunk that describes Albert Einstein's birth date:</p>
<pre class="chk"><code>person Albert_Einstein {
  birthdate 1879-03-14
}</code></pre>
      <p>This chunk implicitly creates the following chunk definition:</p>
<pre class="chk"><code>iso8601 1879-03-14 {
  year 1879
  month 3
  day 14
}
</code></pre>
    </aside>

    <p class="issue">Whether or not to prepend <code>iso8601</code> and its related properties with <code>@</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/cogai/issues/2">issue #2</a>).</p>

    <p>A <dfn>string literal</dfn> is an arbitrary set of characters. It is serialized enclosed in double quotes, following the same grammar as <a data-cite="RFC8259#section-7">strings in JSON</a> [[RFC8259]].</p>

    <p>A <dfn>name</dfn> is a string that can include letters, digits, period, hyphen, underscore and slash characters, and that cannot be interpreted as a [=number=], a [=boolean=]. Additionally, depending on the context under which it is used, a [=name=] may start with one of the name operators (see [[[#name-operators]]]).</p>
  </section>
</section>

  <section>
    <h2>Chunks and graphs</h2>
    <p>A <dfn>chunk</dfn> is a named typed collection of [=properties=]. A [=chunk=] is used to model both declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge as a collection of basic familiar units that have been grouped together and stored in memory.</p>
    <p>A [=chunk=] has a [=type=] and an optional [=identifier=].</p>

    <aside class="note" title="Serialization of a chunk">
      <p>When serialized in a [=chunks document=], the declaration of a [=chunk=] always starts with a chunk [=type=], followed by an optional chunk [=identifier=], and a set of [=properties=] enclosed in braces (<code>{}</code>). Lists are represented as comma separated values. Whitespaces may appear anywhere between constructs. See <a href="#chunks-grammar"></a> for details.</p>
    </aside>
    <aside class="example" title="A chunk to describe a dog">
<pre class="chk">dog dog1 {
  name "Fido"
  age 4
}</pre>
      <p>or using the compact syntax:</p>
<pre class="chk">dog dog1 {name "Fido"; age 4}</pre>
      <p>This [=chunk=] describes a dog named "Fido" that is 4 years old. The chunk [=type=] is <code>dog</code>. Its [=identifier=] is <code>dog1</code> and uniquely identifies this chunk within the graph it is defined in. The chunk has two [=properties=]:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>name</code> whose value is the [=string literal=] <code>"Fido"</code></li>
        <li><code>age</code> whose value is the [=number=] <code>4</code></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The interpretation of <em>age</em> as being stated in years is application dependent. Applications could choose to declare the units with an associated [=property=], e.g. <em>age-units</em> as an application dependent solution.  A more general approach is proposed in the section [[[#data-models]]].</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Chunk type</h3>
      <p>A chunk <dfn>type</dfn> is a [=name=] that documents the nature of a chunk. The [=type=] is used to group and index chunks. [=Rules=] typically apply to chunks of a given [=type=].</p>
      <aside class="example" title="A chunk of type &quot;person&quot;">
<pre class="chk"><code>person Dave {
  knows Francois
}</code></pre>
      </aside>
      <p>As a special case, the [=type=] may be formed by a single asterisk (<code>*</code>), which is used to describe a [=condition=] or [=action=] that matches any chunk [=type=].</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chunk identifier</h3>
      <p>The chunk <dfn>identifier</dfn> is a [=name=] that uniquely identifies a chunk within the graph it is defined in.</p>
      <p>The chunk [=identifier=] is optional. If missing, it will be automatically assigned when the chunk is added to a chunk module.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chunk properties</h3>
      <p>A chunk <dfn>property</dfn> is a [=name=]/[=value=] pair that describes a chunk across the particular dimension identified by the property name.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>value</dfn> is either an [=atomic value=] or an ordered list of [=atomic values=] (values are comma-separated in serialized form).</p>

      <p>An <dfn>atomic value</dfn> is either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a [=name=], which can for instance be used to reference other chunks</li>
        <li>a [=number=]</li>
        <li>a [=boolean=] (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>)</li>
        <li>a [=date=]</li>
        <li>a [=string literal=]</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A property [=value=] |a| <dfn>equals</dfn> property [=value=] |b| when the following algorithm returns <code>true</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If |a| is the [=wild card operator=] <code>*</code>, return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>If |b| is the [=wild card operator=] <code>*</code>, return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>If |a| is the [=negation operator=] <code>!</code>, return <code>false</code>.</li>
        <li>If |b| is the [=negation operator=] <code>!</code>, return <code>false</code>.</li>
        <li>If |a| is a [=name=] that starts with the [=negation operator=] <code>!</code>, return <code>false</code> if !|a| [=equals=] |b|, <code>true</code> otherwise.</li>
        <li>If |b| is a [=name=] that starts with the [=negation operator=] <code>!</code>, return <code>false</code> if |a| [=equals=] !|b|, <code>true</code> otherwise.</li>
        <li>If |a| is a [=variable=] that is not yet [=bound=] to a value, return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>If |b| is a [=variable=] that is not yet [=bound=] to a value, return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>If |a| is a [=variable=] [=bound=] to a value |v|, return <code>true</code> if |v| [=equals=] |b|, <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
        <li>If |b| is a [=variable=] [=bound=] to a value |v|, return <code>true</code> if |a| [=equals=] |v|, <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
        <li>If |a| and |b| are identical [=atomic values=], return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>If |a] and |b| are lists of [=atomic values=], both lists have the same length, and [=atomic values=] at the same position in |a| and |b| are [=equal=], return <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chunk context</h3>
      <p>A [=chunk=] may be scoped to a <dfn>context</dfn>, which identifies the specific situation under which the [=chunk=] should be considered to be true. This mechanism allows [=chunks=] to describe things that are only true in hypothetical situations.</p>

      <p>[=Contexts=] can be used to express situations that involve the use of statements about statements, including beliefs, stories, reported speech, examples in lessons, abductive reasoning and even search query patterns. They are also useful for episodic memory when one wants to describe facts that are true in a given situation, for instance an episode when a person visited a restaurant for lunch, sat by the window, and had soup for starters followed by mushroom risotto for the main course. A sequence of episodes can then be modelled as relationships between contexts.</p>

      <p>A [=chunk=] is associated with a specific [=context=] through an [=@context=] [=property=].</p>

      <p>A [=chunk=] that is not explicitly associated with a [=context=] (i.e. in the absence of an [=@context=] property) belongs to the <dfn>default context</dfn>.</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Expressing a belief">
        <p>Here is an example from John Sowa's <a href="http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/arch.htm">Architectures for Intelligent Systems</a>:</p>
        <p><cite>Tom believes that Mary wants to marry a sailor.</cite></p>
        <p>This example involves talking about a statement <cite>Mary wants to marry a sailor</cite> that is only known to be true according to Tom's belief. When represented as [=chunks=], the statement needs to be associated with a [=context=] that identifies Tom's belief, so that we cannot directly assert that the statement is true in general.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the statement <cite>to marry a sailor</cite> is only known to be true according to Mary's desire. When represented as [=chunks=], the statement also needs to be associated with a [=context=] that identifies Mary's desire.</p>

        <p>Here is one possible way to represent the overall statement with [=chunks=]:</p>
        <pre class="chk">believes {
  @subject tom
  proposition tom-belief-1
}
wants {
  @context tom-belief-1
  @subject mary
  situation mary-desire-1
}
married-to {
  @context mary-desire-1
  @subject mary
  @object s1
}
a s1 {
  @context mary-desire-1
  profession sailor
}</pre>
      </aside>

      <p>As illustrated in the previous example, [=contexts=] can be chained, e.g. to describe the beliefs of someone in a fictional story or movie, and to indicate when a context is part of several other contexts, thus creating a tree of [=contexts=].</p>

      <p>Practically speaking, [=contexts=] make it possible to filter out non relevant [=chunks=] in [=conditions=] and [=actions=]. Two [=chunks=] may only [=match=] when they belong to the same context. For instance, a [=chunk=] that belongs to the context <code>tom-belief-1</code> can only [=match=] [=chunks=] that also belong to that context, and de facto cannot match [=chunks=] that belong to the [=default context=]. In particular, a [=chunk=] that belongs to the [=default context=] can only [=match=] [=chunks=] that also belong to the [=default context=].</p>
      
      <p class="issue">Is there a need for a limited form of automatic inheritance, e.g. when matching chunks in a context for a fictional account, should this also match chunks in the parent context? This would allow general knowledge to apply by default within fictional accounts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Links between chunks</h3>
      <p>In this document, a <dfn>link</dfn> is a directed and labeled connection between two [=chunks=]. A [=link=] is automatically created whenever a chunk property [=value=] is a [=name=] that references an existing chunk [=identifier=].</p>
      <p>The <dfn>subject</dfn> of the [=link=] identifies the [=chunk=] at the origin of the connection. The <dfn>object</dfn> of the [=link=] identifies the [=chunk=] targeted by the connection. The <dfn class="lint-ignore">label</dfn> of the [=link=] is the property [=name=].</p>
      <aside class="example" title="A link between two chunks">
<pre class="chk"><code>friend f34 {
  name Joan
}
friend f35 {
  name Jenny
  likes f34
}</code></pre>
        <p>The above definition creates a link between <code>f35</code> and <code>f34</code> with the relationship <code>likes</code>.</p>
      </aside>

      <p>When a [=chunk=] links to another [=chunk=], this implicitly creates a third [=chunk=] whose [=type=] is the name of the [=property=] that creates the [=link=], and that has two [=properties=]:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><dfn><code>@subject</code></dfn>: references the [=subject=] of a [=link=]</li>
        <li><dfn><code>@object</code></dfn>: references the [=object=] of a [=link=]</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="example" title="Links as chunks">
<pre class="chk"><code>animal dog {
  kindof mammal
}</code></pre>

<p>The previous definition implicitly creates the following [=chunk=]:</p>

<pre class="js">kindof {
  @subject dog
  @object mammal
}</pre>
      </aside>

      <aside class="note" title="Compact format for links">
        <p>The <a href="#chunks-grammar">grammar</a> allows to express [=links=] in a compact format in a [=chunks document=], e.g.:</p>
<pre class="chk">dog kindof mammal
cat kindof mammal</pre>
        <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
        <pre class="chk">kindof {
  @subject dog
  @object mammal
}
kindof {
  @subject cat
  @object mammal
}</pre>
      </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Graph of chunks</h3>
      <p>A <dfn data-lt="graphs of chunks">graph of chunks</dfn> is simply a collection of [=chunks=]. The vertices of the graph are the [=chunks=]. The edges of the graph are the [=links=] between the chunks.</p>
      <p>Since [=links=] are directed, a [=graph of chunks=] is a directed graph.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Rules and modules</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <p>A <dfn>rule</dfn> is a [=chunk=] whose [=type=] is <code>rule</code> and that has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an <dfn><code>@condition</code></dfn> [=property=], whose value is a chunk [=identifier=] or a list thereof, and which is used to reference the rule's [=conditions=].</li>
        <li>an <dfn><code>@action</code></dfn> [=property=], whose value is a chunk [=identifier=] or a list thereof, and which is used to reference the rule's [=actions=].</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A [=rule=] represents a unit of procedural knowledge. Rules consist of [=conditions=] and [=actions=].</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Basic rule definition">
        <p>The following [=rule=] has one [=condition=] (that holds true when the <code>goal</code> [=module buffer=] contains a [=chunk=] whose [=type=] is <code>remember</code>), and two [=actions=] that clears the <code>goal</code> [=module buffer=] and that loads a [=chunk=] whose type is <code>memory</code> in the <code>facts</code> [=module=]:</p>
        <pre class="chk">rule r1 {
  @condition c1
  @action a1, a2
}

remember c1 {}
next a1 { @do clear }
memory a2 { @module facts }</pre>
      </aside>

      <aside class="note" title="Compact format for rules">
        <p>The <a href="#chunks-grammar">grammar</a> allows to express [=rules=] in a compact format in a [=chunks document=]. For instance, the previous example may be written as:</p>
<pre class="chk">remember {} => next { @do clear },  memory { @module facts }</pre>
        <p>This compact format makes the link between [=conditions=] and [=actions=] more explicit and avoids the need to provide chunk [=identifiers=].</p>
      </aside>

      <section>
        <h4>Conditions</h4>
        <p>A <dfn>condition</dfn> is a [=chunk=] that describes the premises that must hold true for a [=rule=] to apply. A [=condition=] identifies which [=module=] it relates to through an [=@module=] property, defaulting to the <code>goal</code> module. A [=condition=] holds true when the [=chunk=] in the related [=module buffer=] is a [=matching chunk=] for the [=condition=].</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Actions</h4>
        <p>An <dfn>action</dfn> is a [=chunk=] that can directly update [=module buffers=], or can do so indirectly, e.g. by sending messages to the [=module=] to invoke graph algorithms, such as graph queries and updates, or to carry out operations, e.g. instructing a robot to move its arm. When the algorithm or operation is complete, a response can be sent back to update the module's buffer. This in turn can trigger further rules as needed. An [=action=] identifies which [=module=] it relates to through an [=@module=] property, defaulting to the <code>goal</code> module.</p>
        <p>In many cases, the actual operation that an [=action=] will carry out will appear as an [=@do=] property. Built-in operations are always supported (see <a href="#built-in-operations"></a>). Other actions may be supported. See section [[[#scripting-api]]] for a means for applications to define additional actions, e.g. as a way to invoke external actions for operating a robot arm or camera.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Matching chunks</h4>

        <p>A [=chunk=] |A| <dfn data-lt="matching chunk">matches</dfn> [=chunk=] |B| if the conditions below are all met:</p>

        <h4>@-properties for conditions and actions</h4>
        <p>The [=reserved names=] defined in this section may be used as [=property=] names in [=conditions=] and [=actions=] to control their behavior.</p>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@compile</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>This used in a rule action to compile a set of chunks in declarative memory into a set of rules in procedural memory. The process starts with the chunk that cites the chunks used for the conditions and actions, and then applies to those chunks.  Note that <code>@compile</code> may cite a list of IDs for chunks to be compiled.</p>
          <aside class="example" title="compile rule from declarative memory to procedural memory">
            <pre class="chk">put {@compile rule1; @map map1}</pre>
            <p>The above [=action=] looks for a chunk with ID <code>rule1</code> in the default module and compiles it using the mappings specified in the chunk with ID <code>map1</code> as specified with <code>@map</code>. The chunk type and ID are copied as is.</p>
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@context</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>When used in a regular [=chunk=], identifies a chunk's [=context=]. When used in a [=condition=] or in an [=action=], [=matches=] a [=chunk=]'s [=context=].</p>

            <pre class="chk">recall { lunch ?restaurant }
     => lookup { @module facts; @do get; @type lunch; @context ?restaurant }</pre>

          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@do</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>Specifies the graph algorithm or operation to execute. See <a href="#built-in-operations"></a> for a list of common operations that are supported across modules.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@for</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>Iterates over a set of items in a comma separated list. The [=@from=] and [=@to=] properties may be used to restrict the iteration range.</p>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@from</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>Specifies the zero-based starting index of an [=@for=] iteration. Value must be an integer.</p>

# after having recalled the person chunk, the
# following rule iterates over the friends
person {@module facts; friends ?friends}
   => item {@module goal; @for ?friends; @from 1; @to 2}</pre>
            <p>which will iterate over Suzy and Janet, updating the module buffer by setting properties for the item's value and its index, e.g.</p>
            <pre class="chk">item {value Suzy; @index 1; @more true}</pre>
            <p>The action's properties are copied over apart from those starting with an <code>@</code>. The item index in the list is copied into the chunk as [=@index=]. You can then use [=@do next=] in an action to load the next item into the buffer. The [=@more=] property is set to true in the buffer if there is more to come, and false for the last property in the iteration. Action chunks should use either [=@do=] or [=@for=], but not both. Neither implies <code>@do update</code>.</p>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@id</code></dfn> property</h5>

          <p>[=Matches=] a [=chunk=]'s [=type=] when that [=type=] is linked to the value of the [=@kindof=] property through a chain of <code>kindof</code> links. The property should be used in conjunction with a <code>*</code> type to match subclasses of a given class in a taxonomy.</p>
          <aside class="example" title="Matching subclasses in a taxonomy">

          <h5>The <dfn><code>@map</code></dfn> property and chunk type</h5>
          <p>This is used with [=@compile=] and [=@uncompile=] to reference a chunk of type [=@map=] that defines a map for property names and their meanings. See also the [=@unmap=] property.</p>
          <aside class="example" title="term map for use in rule compilation and uncompilation">
            <pre class="chk">@map map1 {do @do; condition @condition; action @action; module @module}</pre>
            <p>The above [=chunk=] signifies that <code>do</code> is to be interpreted as [=@do=], <code>condition</code> is to be interpreted as [=@condition=], <code>action</code> is to be interpreted as [=@action=], and so forth. By mapping property names in this way, rules can be used to operate on chunks in declarative memory free of the difficulties posed by properties with the <code>@</code> prefix. The above example would be appropriate for a [=chunk=] such as the following:</p>
            <pre class="chk">rule r1 {condition g1; action a1, a2, a3}</pre>
which is mapped to:
            <pre class="chk">rule r1 {@condition g1; @action a1, a2, a3}</pre>

          <h5>The <dfn><code>@module</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>References the [=module=] a [=condition=] or [=action=] relates to. Value must be the [=module name=] of the targeted [=module=]. In the absence of an [=@module=] property, [=conditions=] and [=actions=] apply to the <code>goal</code> module.</p>

          <h5>The <dfn><code>@pop</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>An [=action=] property that removes the last [=atomic value=] from a [=value=]. If the [=value=] to process is already an [=atomic value=], the underlying property is removed.</p>
          <p>If a [=@to=] property is also present, the removed [=atomic value=] is assigned to the [=property=] identified by the [=@to=] property. In the absence of a [=@to=] property, the removed [=atomic value=] is discarded.</p>

          <h5>The <dfn><code>@status</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>Queries the [=module buffer/status=] of a [=module buffer=]. The [=rule engine=] sets the status of a [=module buffer=] with the outcome of the [=rule=]'s execution. Most operations are asynchronous, except [=@do clear=], [=@do update=] and [=@do queue=].</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@tag</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>This property provides a means for rule conditions to test a module buffer for the result from a preceding action. Use <code>@tag</code> in the action to pass an identifier to the subsequent asynchronous response where it can be accessed via <code>@tag</code> in a rule condition.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>The <dfn><code>@to</code></dfn> property</h5>
          <p>Companion [=action=] property used in [=@do properties=], [=@for=], [=@pop=], [=@push=], [=@shift=], [=@unshift=] operations.</p>
          <p>Meaning and value constraints depend on the operation. See individual operations for details.

    <section>
      <h3>Modules</h3>
      <p>A <dfn>module</dfn> is a [=graph of chunks=] associated with one and only one [=module buffer=]. A [=module=] has a <dfn>module name</dfn> that follows the [=name=] data type, and that is typically used to target the [=module=] in [=@module=] properties.</p>

      <p>A [=module=] supports [=built-in operations=], and may support additional operations defined by the application when the [=module=] is initialized.</p>
      <p>A [=module=] represents a cognitive database on which the [=rule engine=] may operate. It may be viewed as a region in the cerebral cortex, where the [=module buffer=] corresponds to the bundle of nerve fibres connecting to that region.</p>

      <p>The [=rule engine=] automatically creates a module named <code>goal</code>, which will therefore always exist in a rule execution context.</p>

      <p>The [=@module=] property allows [=conditions=] and [=actions=] to reference the [=module name=] of the [=module=] they relate to. In the absence of an [=@module=] property, [=conditions=] and [=actions=] apply to the <code>goal</code> module.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Module buffers</h4>
        <p>A <dfn>module buffer</dfn> is a container for at most one [=chunk=]. The mammalian brain is richly connected locally, and weakly remotely. A [=module buffer=] mimics the constrained communication capacity of the mammalian brains for such long range communication.</p>

        <p>The [=rule engine=] operates on a module's [=graph of chunks=] through its [=module buffer=].</p>

        <p>A [=module buffer=] has a <dfn data-dfn-for="module buffer">status</dfn>, (accessible via [=@status=]), whose value is initially [=status/okay=], and which reflects the outcome of the last [=action=] held and performed by the [=module buffer=]. Values can be:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore"><code>pending</code></dfn></dt>
          <dd>The operation is still pending.</dd>
          <dt><dfn><code>okay</code></dfn></dt>
          <dd>The operation completed successfully.</dd>
          <dd><p class="issue">Switch to <code>ok</code>? This seems more common in technologies (e.g. HTTP) than <code>okay</code>.</p></dd>
          <dt><dfnclass="lint-ignore"><code>forbidden</code></dfn></dt>
          <dd>The operation was not allowed.</dd>
          <dt><dfnclass="lint-ignore"><code>nomatch</code></dfn></dt>
          <dd>The operation [=failed=] because there was no [=matching chunk=] for the [=action=] in the targeted [=module=].</dd>
          <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore"><code>failed</code></dfn></dt>
          <dd>The operation failed.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>This is analogous to the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and allows rule engines to work with remote cognitive databases. To relate particular request and response pairs, use [=@tag=] in the action to pass an identifier to the subsequent asynchronous response where it can be accessed via [=@tag=] in a rule condition.</p>

        <p>A [=module buffer=] has a <dfn>queue</dfn>, which is a set of [=chunks=], initially empty. Each chunk in the [=queue=] has a <dfn>priority</dfn>, represented by an integer from 1 to 10, with 10 the highest priority. The default [=priority=] is 5. [=Chunks=] are ordered by descending [=priority=] in a [=queue=]. When [=priorities=] match, [=chunks=] are ordered by insertion order (first in, first out).</p>

        <p>The [=@priority=] property lets [=actions=] set the [=priority=] of a [=chunk=] when they add it to a [=queue=].</p>

        <aside class="note" title="Queue and sub-goals">
          <p>A [=queue=] may be useful to create sub-goals. For instance, whilst [=@do update=] operations allow applications to switch to a new goal, they may prefer [=rules=] to propose multiple sub-goals instead. [=Queues=] enable this through [=@do queue=] operations which push the [=chunk=] specified by an [=action=] to the [=queue=] of a [=module buffer=].</p>
        </aside>

        <p>A [=module buffer=] is automatically cleared when the [=actions=] associated with the [=rule=] it contained did not update the contents of targeted [=module buffers=]. This pops the [=queue=] if it is not already empty.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Built-in operations</h4>
        <p>The [=@do=] property lets an [=action=] specify the graph algorithm or operation to execute. The default operation is to update the [=module buffer=], similar to calling [=@do update=].</p>

        <p>All [=modules=] support the <dfn>built-in operations</dfn> defined in this section.</p>

        <p>All [=modules=] also support the [=@for=] property to iterate over a set of items in a comma separated list. This has the effect of loading the [=module buffer=] with the first item in the list. The index range can optionally be specified with [=@from=] and [=@to=], where the first item in the list has index <code>0</code>.</p>

        <aside class="note" title="Application-defined operations">
          <p>Applications can define additional operations when initialising a [=module=]. This can be used to perform a variety of operations, e.g. to allow rules to command a robot to move its arm, by passing it the desired position and direction of the robot's hand. Operations can be defined to allow messages to be spoken aloud or to support complex graph algorithms, e.g. for data analytics and machine learning.</p>

          <p>Applications cannot replace the [=built-in operations=].</p>

          <p>If the [=chunk=] in the targeted [=module buffer=] has the same [=identifier=] as a [=chunk=] in the underlying [=graph of chunks=], patches the [=chunk=] in the [=graph of chunks=] with the [=properties=] that appear in the [=module buffer=], excluding [=properties=] prefixed with an <code>@</code> character.</p>
          <p class="issue">What is the expected behavior when the action has an <code>@id</code> property?

          <p>Initiates an iteration over the [=properties=] of the [=matching chunk=] that do not begin with <code>@</code>. Each [=property=] is mapped to a new [=chunk=] with the same [=type=] as the [=action=]. The action's properties are copied over, and <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> properties are used to pass the [=property=] name and value respectively. The [=@more=] property is given the value <code>true</code> unless this is the final [=chunk=] in the iteration, in which case [=@more=] is given the value false. By default, the iteration is written to the same [=module buffer=] as designated by the [=action=] that initiated it. However, you can designate a different [=module buffer=] with the [=@to=] property. By setting additional properties in the initiating action, you can ensure that the rules used to process the property name and value are distinct from other such iterations.</p>
          <aside class="example" title="Iterate over properties">

          <p class="issue">How can one update the properties prefixed with an <code>@</code> character in a [=chunk=] such as [=@context=], [=@subject=] or [=@object=]?

    <h2>Name operators</h2>
    <p>Operators defined in this section may be used on their own as [=names=] or in front of [=names=] to alter their meaning.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The variable operator <code>?</code></h3>

      <p>The <dfn class="lint-ignore">variable operator</dfn> <code>?</code> may be prepended to a [=name=] when used as a [=property=] value to turn the [=name=] into a <dfn>variable</dfn> which represents a symbolic name to a [=value=]. A [=variable=] gets <dfn>bound</dfn> to a [=value=] in a [=condition=]. The [=value=] can then be referenced in [=actions=] using the [=variable=]'s name. Effectively, [=variables=] allow applications to copy information from rule [=conditions=] to rule [=actions=].</p>

      <p>[=Variables=] are scoped to the [=rule=] where they appear.</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Variable binding and referencing">
        <pre class="chk">count { state start; from ?num1; to ?num2 }

        <p>The above [=rule=] defines a [=condition=] that [=matches=] a [=chunk=] in the <code>goal</code> [=module buffer=] whose [=type=] is <code>count</code>, that has a <code>state</code> [=property=] whose value is <code>start</code>, and that has <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> [=properties=]. The [=condition=] binds the value of the [=variable=] <code>?num1</code> to the [=value=] of the <code>from</code> [=property=] in the matching chunk, and the value of the [=variable=] <code>?num2</code> to the [=value=] of the <code>to</code> [=property=].</p>
        <p>The [=rule=] defines an [=action=] that looks for a [=chunk=] in the <code>facts</code> [=module=] whose [=type=] is <code>increment</code> and that has a [=property=] named <code>number</code> and whose [=value=] equals the value of the <code>?num1</code> [=variable=].</p>
      </aside>

      <p>[=Variables=] are [=bound=] to a [=value=] the first time they appear in a [=condition=]. Subsequent occurrences of the same [=variable=] in a [=condition=] reference their [=value=].</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Variable binding and referencing in the same condition">
        <pre class="chk">count { state start; from ?num1; to ?num1 }
=> console { @do log; message ?num1 }</pre>
        <p>The above [=rule=] defines a [=condition=] that [=matches=] a [=chunk=] in the <code>goal</code> [=module buffer=] whose [=type=] is <code>count</code>, that has a <code>state</code> [=property=] whose value is <code>start</code>, and that has <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> [=properties=] that have identical values. The [=condition=] binds the value of the [=variable=] <code>?num1</code> to the [=value=] of the <code>from</code> [=property=] in the matching chunk.</p>
      </aside>

      <p>[=Variables=] may represent any type of [=value=]. In particular, a [=variable=] that [=matches=] a property whose value is a list of [=atomic values=] gets bound to the list of [=atomic values=].</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Variable binding to a list of atomic values">
        <pre class="chk">basket { fruit ?f }
=> console { @do log; message ?f }</pre>
        <p>The above [=rule=] defines a [=condition=] that [=matches=] a [=chunk=] in the <code>goal</code> [=module buffer=] whose [=type=] is <code>basket</code> and that has a <code>fruit</code> [=property=]. Given the following [=chunk=] in the <code>goal</code> [=module buffer=], the [=condition=] binds variable <code>?f</code> to <code>apple, banana, orange</code>:</p>
        <pre class="chk">basket { fruit apple, banana, orange }</pre>
      </aside>

      <p>A [=condition=] that contains a [=property=] with a list of [=variables=] [=matches=] a list of [=atomic values=] that has the same length. The [=condition=] does not [=match=] when the lengths of the lists differ.</p>

      <h3>The negation operator <code>!</code></h3>
      <p>The <dfn data-lt="negative operation">negation operator</dfn> <code>!</code> may be prepended to [=names=] to <dfn class="lint-ignore">negate</dfn> the outcome of their evaluation. The [=negation operator=] may be used in one of the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a [=rule=] in front of a [=condition=] to negate it. A rule with a negated [=condition=] !|cond| applies if and only if |cond| does not hold true.

            <p>The above example illustrates two equivalent ways to define a rule with a negated condition. In this example, the condition |c1| [=matches=] a [=chunk=] whose [=type=] is <code>person</code> and whose [=identifier=] is <code>John</code>.

    <h2>Rule engine execution</h2>
    <p>The rule engine is invoked whenever any of the module buffers are changed, including when [=queue=] is popped. It then searches for rules whose conditions match the current state of the buffers. If a rule has multiple conditions, they must all match the current state of the buffers. If there are multiple matching rules, a stochastic process is applied to select which one to execute. This process is based upon the activation of the rule's root chunk, i.e. the chunk with [=@condition=] and [=@action=]. The higher the activation, the more likely the rule will be selected. See Section [[[#mimicking-human-memory]]].</p>
    <p>Executing a rule is a process in which the sequence of actions are applied in the same order that they appear in the rule. Actions are for the most part asynchronous with a few exceptions, see Section [[[#rules]]]. Implementations may index module buffers to speed the process of matching rule conditions to the buffers. One such approach involves a discrimination network akin to Charles Forgy's [[Rete Match Algorithm]].</p>

    <h2>Mapping to RDF</h2>

    <p>Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]], at the basis of RDF [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]], is a way to create a network of standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data, and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on different sites across the Web.

    <p>[=Names=] used in [=chunks=] are local to the [=graph of chunks=] in which they appear. For [=names=] to be usable as linked data, there needs to be a way to associate them to global identifiers. [=Reserved names=] defined in this section may be used to create such a mapping.</p>

    <p>In turn, this mechanism can be used to map a [=graph of chunks=] to an <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a> and vice versa.</p>

    <p class="note">Algorithms to serialize/deserialize a [=graph of chunks=] to an <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a> and vice versa are out of scope of this document but may be specified in future revisions of it.</p>

    <aside class="example" title="Mapping a graph of chunks to an RDF graph">
      <p>Given the following [=graph of chunks=]:</p>
      <pre class="chk">@rdfmap {
  dog http://example.com/ns/dog
  cat http://example.com/ns/cat
  age http://example.com/ns/age
  name http://example.com/ns/name
}

dog { name "Youki"; age 5 }
cat { name "Isidore"; age 3 }</pre>
      <p>The [=@rdfmap=] [=chunk=] creates a mapping between local names and a URL. This [=graph of chunks=] is equivalent to the following <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a> expressed in Turtle [[TURTLE]]:</p>
      <pre class="chk"><code>&lt;http://example.org/ns/dog&gt;

    <section>
      <h3>The <dfn><code>@rdfmap</code></dfn> type</h3>
      <p>The [=@rdfmap=] chunk [=type=] identifies a chunk that defines a mapping between [=names=] and <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> [[IRI]]. Each [=property=] it defines whose [=name=] does not start with one of the name operators (see [[[#name-operators]]]) creates a mapping between this [=name=] and the property [=value=], interpreted as an <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr>.</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Mapping a name to the schema.org vocabulary">
        <pre class="chk"># Maps the name "thing" to the "Thing" item type in schema.org
@rdfmap {
  thing http://schema.org/Thing
}</pre>
      </aside>

      <p class="note">The [=@rdfmap=] keyword plays the same role in [=chunks=] as the <code>@context</code> keyword in JSON-LD. See the notion of <a data-cite="JSON-LD#the-context">Context in JSON-LD</a> for details [[JSON-LD]]. The term [=context=] and the [=@context=] keyword have a different meaning in [=chunks=] where they identify the specific situation under which a [=chunk=] should be considered to be true. A distinct [=@rdfmap=] keyword is used here to avoid any confusion.</p>

      <p>If multiple [=@rdfmap=] chunks create a mapping for the same [=name=], the last definition in overrides previous ones.</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Conflicting mapping">
        <pre class="chk"># Creates a mapping from image to the example.org namespace
@rdfmap { image http://example.org/ns/image }

# overrides the initial mapping defined above.
thing { image img1 }

# New mapping definition for image, overrides former one
@rdfmap { image http://schema.org/image }</pre>
      </aside>

      <p>An [=@rdfmap=] chunk may also contain a [=@base=] property to create a default <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr> namespace for [=names=] and [=@prefix=] properties to define prefixes for compact <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr>.</p>

        <p>In this example, the [=@rdfmap=] chunk maps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>dog</code> to <code>http://example.org/ns/dog</code></li>
          <li><code>name</code> to <code>http://schema.org/name</code></li>
          <li><code>birthDate</code> to <code>http://schema.org/birthDate</code></li>
        </ul>
      </aside>

      <p>There can be only one default <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr> namespace for a given [=graph of chunks=]. If [=@base=] is used in multiple [=@rdfmap=] chunks, the last definition overrides previous ones.</p>

      <h3>The <dfn><code>@prefix</code></dfn> property</h3>
      <p>The [=@prefix=] [=property=] can be used in an [=@rdfmap=] chunk to reference a [=chunk=] that defines <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr> prefixes, which in turn allow the use of compact <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> in the [=@rdfmap=] chunk.</p>

      <p>The actual [=chunk=] that defines prefixes can have any [=type=]. Each [=property=] it defines whose [=name=] does not start with one of the name operators (see [[[#name-operators]]]) creates a prefix between the property [=name=] and the property [=value=], interpreted as an <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr>.</p>

      <aside class="example" title="Use compact IRIs in @rdfmap">
        <pre class="chk">prefix p1 {
  dcterms http://purl.org/dc/terms/
  foaf http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
}

@rdfmap {
  @prefix p1
  title dcterms:title
  topic foaf:topic
}

book {
  title "Chunks of life"
  topic "Mammalian rules"
}</pre>
        <p>The [=@rdfmap=] chunk in this example maps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>title</code> to the compact <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr> <code>dcterms:title</code>, which gets expanded to <code>http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</code> through the [=@prefix=] property</li>
          <li><code>topic</code> to the compact <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr> <code>foaf:topic</code>, which gets expanded to <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/topic</code> through the [=@prefix=] property</li>
        </ul>
      </aside>

      <p>As with [=@base=], in case of conflicts, the definition that gets referenced last overrides former definitions.</p>

      <aside class="example" title="">
        <pre class="chk">prefix last { foaf http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ }
prefix first { foaf http://example.org/ns/ }

@rdfmap { @prefix first; nick foaf:nick }
@rdfmap { @prefix last }</pre>
        <p>The last [=@rdfmap=] definition makes the <code>foaf</code> prefix map to <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</code>, overriding the previous mapping to <code>http://example.org/ns/</code>. The <code>nick</code> [=name=] gets mapped to <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick</code> as a consequence.</p>

    <h2>Data Models</h2>
    
    <p>This section describes potential ways for using [=chunks=] to declare the properties and values expected for a given chunk [=type=]. Here is an example for a chunk type for a bottle:</p>
    
    <aside class="example" title="">
        <pre class="chk"># bottle
thing bottle {properties level, capped}
type level {isa number; min 0; max 100; initial 0}
type capped {isa boolean; initial false}</pre>
    </aside>
    
    <p>The first chunk declares that chunks of [=type=] <em>bottle</em> have two properties: <em>level</em> and <em>capped</em>. The following chunks provide metadata for those [=properties=]. You can declare the data type for the property along with its initial value. You can provide the minimum and maximum value for numeric property values. This approach is useful for properties whose meaning and data model is the same regardless of the chunk [=type=] they are used in.</p>
    
    <p>Here is a further example that introduces additional data types, along with the means to describe properties  specific to a given chunk [=type=],</p>
    
    <aside class="example" title="">
        <pre class="chk"># belts
thing belt {properties x, y, length, moving, items}

type length {isa integer}
type moving {isa boolean; initial false}

# belts hold a list of items with a position and width
type items {isa list; contains item}
thing item {properties position, p2}
type position {isa number}

# instead of type width {isa number; min 0}
# you can restrict the specific property
# when properties with the same name for
# different things have different metadata

property p2 {name width; isa number; min 0}</pre>
    </aside>
    
    <p>The values for <code>properties</code> can either be the name of a property, e.g. <em>position</em> or a chunk ID for a chunk of [=type=] <em>property</em>, that names the property in question and describes its data model.</p>
    
    <p>For properties whose value is either a name or a sequence of names, you can use <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> to specify constraints on the length of the sequence, e.g. <code>min 1; max 1</code> to require a single value for the associated property.</p>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Validation and Richer Queries</h3>
      
      <p>Data models can be used to check that a [=graph of chunks=] conforms to the constraints defined by the data model. In principle, a new [=@do=] action could be defined to invoke such checks. Such a command is not standardised in this specification, but could be readily implemented as an application defined action, see section [[[#scripting-api]]].</p>
      
      <p>The built-in <code>@</code> actions provide standard ways to query and update chunk graphs.  Rich queries could generate chunk graphs as a result of their execution. Such queries can be expressed as a set of chunks and executed using application defined graph algorithms implemented using the [[[#scripting-api]]]. The built-in <code>@</code> actions can then be used to access the graphs generated by richer queries.</p>

    <h2>Mimicking Human Memory</h2>
    
    <p>Human memory focuses on what is useful based upon past experience. Memories fade over time unless they are used. Chunks support sub-symbolic parameters that mimic characteristics of human memory. The chunk activation is boosted each time the chunk is updated or recalled. It then decays over time like a leaky capacitor replicating the forgetting curve for human memory.</p>
    <p>Chunk recall is stochastic and influenced by the chunk's activation. Chunk buffers can only hold a single chunk. If matching chunks have the same activation, they are equally likely to be selected and loaded into the module's chunk buffer, otherwise the stronger the activation, the more likely a matching chunk will be selected. Chunks mimic the spacing effect in that the boost to a given chunk is progressively reduced if it occurs within a short time since the chunk was last boosted.</p>
    <p>Chunks further support spreading activation each time a chunk is updated or recalled. This boosts related chunks that are referenced from chunk property values in a wave that weakens as it spreads out. The greater the fan-out from a given chunk, the weaker the boost given to the linked chunks. You can think of this as a fixed amount of energy that is divided across the links and partially absorbed by each chunk it reaches. The wave stops when it falls below a threshold level.</p> 
    
    <p class="issue">Need to explain how reinforcement learning boosts chunk rules based upon the number of steps needed to accomplish a task, along with how this supports machine learning for rule sets.</p>

    <h2>Scripting API</h2>
    
	<p>This section describes the scripting API exposed by the original JavaScript library for chunks and rules, see [[CHUNKS-DEMOS]]. The starting point is to create a graph from a text string containing the source of the chunks that make up the graph. The following code creates two graphs: one for facts from "facts.chk", and another for rules from "rules.chk".</p>

	<pre class="code">
	let facts, rules;
	fetch("facts.chk")
	.then((response) => response.text())
	.then(function (source) {
		facts = new ChunkGraph(source);
		fetch("rules.chk")
		.then((response) => response.text())
		.then(function (source) {
			rules = new ChunkGraph(source);
		});
	});</pre>

	<p>Here are some operations you perform on a graph:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt><code>new ChunkGraph(source)</code></dt>
	<dd>Create a new graph from a text string containing the chunks and links.</dd>

	<dt><code>graph.chunks[id]</code></dt>
	<dd>Find a chunk given its id.</dd>

	<dt><code>graph.types[type]</code></dt>
	<dd>Find the list of chunks with a given type.</dd>

	<dt><code>graph.forall(kind, handler, context)</code></dt>
	<dd>Apply a function to all chunks whose type has the <code>kindof</code> relationship to the given <code>kind</code>. This applies recursively to chains of <code>kindof</code> relationships. The handler is a function that is passed the chunk and the <code>context</code>.<dd>

	<dt><code>graph.get(type, values)</code></dt>
	<dd>Recall a chunk with a given type, and matching values as denoted by a JavaScript object with a set of named properties. Note that this is stochastic and returns the 'best' chunk when there are multiple matches.</dd>
	</dl>

	<dt><code>graph.put(type, values, id)</code></dt>
	<dd>Remember (i.e. create and store) a chunk with a given type, and matching values as denoted by a JavaScript object with a set of named properties. The chunk id will be assigned automatically if not supplied.</dd>

	<dt><code>graph.delete(type, values, id)</code></dt>
	<dd>Remove the chunk with a given ID if provided, otherwise forget the set of chunks with the given type and matching values.</dd>

	<dt><code>graph.parse(source)</code></dt>
	<dd>Parse source as chunks and add to this graph.</dd>

	<dt><code>graph.add(chunk)</code></dt>
	<dd>Adds a chunk or link to the graph, see below for ways to create chunks and links. If the chunk is currently part of another graph, it will be removed from that graph before being added to this one.</dd>

	<dt><code>graph.remove(chunk)</code></dt>
	<dd>Remove a chunk or link from the graph.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>Here are some operations you perform on a chunk:</p>

	<dl>
	<dt><code>new Chunk(type, id)</code></dt>
	<dd>Create a new chunk for a given type and id. The id is optional and will be assigned automatically when the chunk is added to a graph if not supplied.</dd>

	<dt><code>new Link(subject, predicate, object)</code></dt>
	<dd>Create a new Link as a subclass of chunk where the chunk type is given by the predicate. The chunk id will be assigned automatically when the Link is added to a graph.</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.id</code></dt>
	<dd>Access the chunk's id.</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.type</code></dt>
	<dd>Access the chunk's type.</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.properties[name]</code></dt>
	<dd>Access a chunk property value given the property's name.</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.setValue(name, value)</code></dt>
	<dd>Overwrite the value of a named property</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.addValue(name, value)</code></dt>
	<dd>Add a value for named property. An array is used only if the property value has multiple values.</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.removeValue(name)</code></dt>
	<dd>Remove a value from the named property - this is the inverse of <code>addValue</code>.</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.hasValue(name, value)</code></dt>
	<dd>Returns <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> according to whether the named property contains the given value, i.e. the property is either that value or it is a list, one of whose items is that value. If the property is undefined for this chunk, then the return value is <em>false</em>.</dd>

	<dt><code>chunk.toString()</code></dt>
	<dd>Returns a pretty printed version of the chunk.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The following describes the API for rule engines:</p>

	<dl>
	<dt><code>new RuleEngine()</code></dt>
	<dd>Create a new rule engine.</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.addModule(name, graph[, backend])</code></dt>
	<dd><p>Registers a new local module with its name, graph and an optional backend for graph algorithms.</p>

	<p>The backend is declared as an object whose property values are functions that implement the algorithm identified by the property's name. The algorithm's name can then used with <code>@do</code> in rule actions for this module. The action is passed a single argument that is an object whose property values are the bindings for the variables identified by the object's property names.</p>

	<p>The backend functions can be used to override the default actions for <em>recall, remember</em> and <em>update</em>. Note that "rules" and "goals" are required modules. The rules module is used to hold procedural knowledge as a set of rules. By default, the "goals" module is initialised to an empty graph. A separate method is envisaged for adding remote modules.</p></dd>

	<dt><code>engine.getModule(name)</code></dt>
	<dd>Return the module created by calling <code>engine.addModule</code>.</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.start(rules, facts[, initial_goal])</code></dt>
	<dd>A convenience function to set the rules and facts modules, along with an optional initial chunk, that is provided as a chunk, i.e. as source text. Note: <code>rules</code> is a graph containing the rules that define procedural knowledge, and <code>facts</code> is a graph containing a set of chunks that define declarative knowledge. The goal is not used until you call engine.next().</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.next()</code></dt>
	<dd>Find and execute the next matching rule.</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.setGoal(source)</code></dt>
	<dd>Parse the source for a chunk and load it into the goal module's buffer.</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.setBuffer(name, source)</code></dt>
	<dd>Parse the source for a chunk and add it to the named module's graph, then load it into the module's buffer.</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.setBuffer(name, chunk)</code></dt>
	<dd>Load the chunk into the named module's buffer.</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.getBuffer(name)</code></dt>
	<dd>Return the chunk in the named module's buffer.</dd>

	<dt><code>engine.addListener(listener)</code></dt>
	<dd>Register a listener function that will be called when any of the module buffers are updated. The listener is passed a single argument identifying the module by name.</dd>
